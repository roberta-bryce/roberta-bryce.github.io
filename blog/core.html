    <div class="entry-contents">
      <span class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway? </span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Everyone I’ve met that are happy in their careers went with the flow, taking different opportunities and pivoting along the way as they improve in their field. I feel like especially in the tech sphere it is hard to predict your future role as it keeps updating. </p>
        <p>My intention is to enter the Web Design field using this course and my degree in Visual Communication Design to find an entry web design role. I’d like time to get used to applying my new skills, but overall I hope to seize opportunities and keep upping my skills to advance my career. Maybe even one day working for myself. </p>
    </span>

      <span class="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Probably my best strength is that I’ve never stopped learning! I’ve worked a lot of jobs, many of which require training - so I’m used to a professional learning environment. But, in my own time I also like to gain new skills; at the moment I’m learning how to sew and on to my second project in a month. Because I enjoy learning and seeing personal improvement I’m used to being bad at things and having to ask a lot of questions to get better.</p>
        <p>Limitation-wise I can get pretty distracted. If I’m not 100% applied to my work my mind will wander, it’s part of the reason I opted for this bootcamp approach as moving at a fast pace keeps me on task. So far I’ve been making personal deals, for example I’ll agree to work an hour for a grilled cheese sandwich… bribery keeps me motivated. Also the toggl app has been helpful with charting how much actual work I do in the day, so keeping that up will be useful.</p>
        </span>

      <span class="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span>
      <span class="answer">
       <p>Networking will be great! I’ve never really understood how people ‘network’, I’ve had friends help me get jobs before, but networking seems like a mysterious skill specific to career advancement. </p>
       <p>Discipline is a skill I’ve always wanted to improve in, I get pretty lenient on myself so I’m hoping through this course I’ll develop some good habits and improve my self-discipline.  That way in the future I’ll be better set up to continue self-study.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</span>
      <span class="sub-question">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>I’ve set up a routine of being awake at 9 and studying by 9:30am. Then I use the toggl app to chart time, I usually go for a 2 hour chunk unless I’m super into it and then do a little break. My breaks usually involve walking my dog so I’m away from the computer and getting that vitamin D. End of the day I do some yoga to unwind both my brain and body… I spent over a year in lockdown overseas so I’ve gained habits to keep my health up while staying at home.</p>
      <p>Safety wise I’m studying from home, this way just in case anything does happen everyone in my bubble shouldn’t be affected. </p>
      </span>
      <span class="sub-question">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Step away, take a break. Usually when I’m in that kind of state it’s best to do a reset; as simple as a nap, changing activity, or dragging my friends out. After getting some distance and perspective I’m in a way better headspace to tackle the problem</p>
      </span>
    </span>

      <span class="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</span>
      <span class="answer">
     <p>I’m living with my parents for the first time in 10 years, 5 years of that spent overseas. So, they are pretty zoned in on what I’m up to and excited to support me. If I needed help they are always around.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Having a team available is fantastic, as I can research on the internet forever but learning from a person directly always feels a lot more in-depth.  I’m looking forward to having real-time classes, and hopefully being able to go over understanding/troubleshooting with facilitators in the future. Critiques on projects will also be fantastic.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>DevAcademy is literally my only commitment, everything else is loose</p>

    <div class="entry-contents">
      <span class="question">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Starting out with some tough questions!</p> 

        <p>My last job in hospitality was at a french fine dining restaurant that had just opened up in the financial district of the city. On the outside it was chic, the food good, and service high quality… but it had a dirty secret.</p>
        
        <p>The polishing station where all glassware, cutlery, and crockery went through was in the disabled toilet. It was a disabled toilet that was still being actively used, although rarely, but definitely not food safe or professional. I addressed this with a manager and was assured this was just ‘growing pains’ and ‘temporary’. About a week later Covid-19 came and everything got put on hold.</p>
        
        <p>Now fast forward several months of isolation I’m called back into the restaurant, and back into the disabled toilets polishing… nothing was resolved and if anything my managers became more defensive about the polishing station being there. I was now put in a position where I was embarrassed about my work, for the guest experience, and also just spending way too much time in a toilet to be healthy.</p>
        
        <p>This led to the ethical decision of whether to report the restaurant for food safety violations in the middle of a pandemic. In the end I quit the job for my own mental health and didn’t report the issue due to not wanting to gamble on what would happen to my coworkers if the restaurant shut down. I valued their ability to make rent over malpractice.</p>
        
        <p>In the end, although this caused the least damage for my coworkers, my decision didn’t resolve the issue and ended up causing a domino effect of bad news for myself. The decision to quit was definitely my personal responsibility, but the decision to report the issue was on everyone that worked there. Hopefully since reopening the polishing room in the disabled toilet is no more, but I’ll never know for sure.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Friends, family, community you see how the people you know act or behave and it informs how you act or behave. This is pretty integral to how I’ve formed my values and identity. I like thinking about why people made their decisions in order to gain different perspectives and see if their decision is something I can align myself to or further question.</p> 

        <p>Sometimes I catch myself saying phrases and using words of the people I know and I’m like that’s a Kyle-ism or whomever. So, I think a lot filters into my brain without even noticing, but I like the people I surround myself with so I'm happy with it.</p>

        <p>I don’t like summarizing myself or others, in my opinion it’s not an effective way to learn about someone. My one shared value is that I think it’s best to get to know people organically, hopefully we will learn more about each other throughout this course.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>I think I’ve got two big strengths that will support me; I’ve never stopped learning, and I’m crazy motivated.</p>

        <p>I’ve worked a lot of jobs in the past, and the most recent ones I’ve had were pretty specialized. I’ve done a lot of learning in order to get good at my job position and developed a method I feel is pretty effective for me. Due to being in training often I also don’t have any hang ups asking for help, I know I learn slowly and I know I’m not the only one like that so I think it’s useful to ask a lot of questions.</p>

        <p>Now those jobs I mentioned, especially the toilet job, that’s my motivation. I don’t want to be in a position like that again and with this opportunity at Dev Academy with the blessing that be TTAF piled on top I’d be a fool to not milk this. I’m here to improve my standing in life and 15 weeks of hard work is a small sacrifice.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>I learn slowly, it takes a while for a concept to infiltrate my brain. I account for this though and diversify my sources until I find something my brain can digest, also I keep applying new concepts practically as repetition/testing is key, and make sure to paraphrase the concept back to teachers to double check I’ve got it right. It’s a quirk but now that I’m older and more confident one I don’t mind navigating.</p>

        <p>This will also be my first course done at home, it’s new and a bit isolating but I think there is a silver lining - self-sufficiency. I’ve encountered a few errors/problems already but I’m trying to build the habit of problem solving myself so that I don’t become too reliant on the teachers. Hopefully this way post Dev Academy I can hit the ground running.</p>

      <span class="question">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>I’ve not had this problem in my professional life, but did encounter it in University. There was a group project with four people in total; three of us were really into the concept and excited to do the work, but one member didn’t want to participate.</p>

        <ul>We tried several strategies:
        <li>Letting them take the first pick of what to do, hoping that would increase their engagement</li>
        <li>Taking meeting notes, so they could catch up easily on missed meetings</li>
        <li>Starting a group chat for increased input</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>None of these strategies were effective, so we toned it down a bit and started giving them the absolute easiest tasks. Which also didn’t work, it turned out that person valued their hobby/personal life over the University project and entered the group with that mindset. We had a frank discussion about participation, effort, and accountability - which also fell on deaf ears. The three of us completed the project and in the hand-in we disclosed the group dynamic.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure what other strategies could be tried, in my opinion from day one of that group project that member decided they didn’t want to do anything and no amount of persuading was going to make them change their mind. </p>
