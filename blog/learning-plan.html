    </div>

    <div class="entry-contents">
      <span class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway? </span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>To get into tech using the abilities I gained from this webdev course and my previous studies in graphic design.</p>
        <p>I’m still keeping my career pathway open as I believe this is a developing industry and I don’t want to turn down an opportunity because it didn’t align with my expectations.</p>
    </span>

      <span class="question">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Biggest strength is definitely persistence. I intend on getting the most out of this experience so I can graduate feeling proud of what I accomplished.</p>
        <p>For limitations it’s probably my own skill-level, I’m not feeling too confident entering boot camp and I anticipate having a bit of a struggle as I learn.</p>
        </span>

      <span class="question">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>The long hours will get to me for sure!</p>
        <p>Especially with the heavy mental work I tend to feel drained. I’m going to have to set myself up well to care for my physical and mental health in order to overcome this challenge.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Would be great to gain more self-discipline as I think it’ll be advantageous throughout this course, later in work, and also in personal aspects of life. I’m hoping between the core work and the workload itself I’ll gain some good habits to aid in improving my own discipline.</p>
      </span>
      

      <span class="question">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>I’m looking forward to live lectures! I love learning directly from people in a way I can ask questions, so I am very excited for that opportunity. I also expect to be able to contact someone for help when I’m super stuck on a subject. </p>
        <p>We’ll see though as I’ve never gone on a course like this, so I’m really not too sure what to expect.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>I expect to be working hard. I’m already having a difficult time with JavaScript so I don’t think this is going to get any easier. As long as I keep on top of my workload and make sure I understand as I go I’ll take that as a win. If I can also produce final projects I'm proud of I'll be thrilled!</p>
        <p>I also hope to make connections with other people in this course. I like meeting people in the same boat as me. As we’ll get through this course together and then later get through job hunting together - it’ll be great to have friends going through the same experiences.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="entry-contents">
      <span class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway? </span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Everyone I’ve met that are happy in their careers went with the flow, taking different opportunities and pivoting along the way as they improve in their field. I feel like especially in the tech sphere it is hard to predict your future role as it keeps updating. </p>
        <p>My intention is to enter the Web Design field using this course and my degree in Visual Communication Design to find an entry web design role. I’d like time to get used to applying my new skills, but overall I hope to seize opportunities and keep upping my skills to advance my career. Maybe even one day working for myself. </p>
    </span>

      <span class="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Probably my best strength is that I’ve never stopped learning! I’ve worked a lot of jobs, many of which require training - so I’m used to a professional learning environment. But, in my own time I also like to gain new skills; at the moment I’m learning how to sew and on to my second project in a month. Because I enjoy learning and seeing personal improvement I’m used to being bad at things and having to ask a lot of questions to get better.</p>
        <p>Limitation-wise I can get pretty distracted. If I’m not 100% applied to my work my mind will wander, it’s part of the reason I opted for this bootcamp approach as moving at a fast pace keeps me on task. So far I’ve been making personal deals, for example I’ll agree to work an hour for a grilled cheese sandwich… bribery keeps me motivated. Also the toggl app has been helpful with charting how much actual work I do in the day, so keeping that up will be useful.</p>
        </span>

      <span class="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span>
      <span class="answer">
       <p>Networking will be great! I’ve never really understood how people ‘network’, I’ve had friends help me get jobs before, but networking seems like a mysterious skill specific to career advancement. </p>
       <p>Discipline is a skill I’ve always wanted to improve in, I get pretty lenient on myself so I’m hoping through this course I’ll develop some good habits and improve my self-discipline.  That way in the future I’ll be better set up to continue self-study.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</span>
      <span class="sub-question">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>I’ve set up a routine of being awake at 9 and studying by 9:30am. Then I use the toggl app to chart time, I usually go for a 2 hour chunk unless I’m super into it and then do a little break. My breaks usually involve walking my dog so I’m away from the computer and getting that vitamin D. End of the day I do some yoga to unwind both my brain and body… I spent over a year in lockdown overseas so I’ve gained habits to keep my health up while staying at home.</p>
      <p>Safety wise I’m studying from home, this way just in case anything does happen everyone in my bubble shouldn’t be affected. </p>
      </span>
      <span class="sub-question">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Step away, take a break. Usually when I’m in that kind of state it’s best to do a reset; as simple as a nap, changing activity, or dragging my friends out. After getting some distance and perspective I’m in a way better headspace to tackle the problem</p>
      </span>
    </span>

      <span class="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</span>
      <span class="answer">
     <p>I’m living with my parents for the first time in 10 years, 5 years of that spent overseas. So, they are pretty zoned in on what I’m up to and excited to support me. If I needed help they are always around.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Having a team available is fantastic, as I can research on the internet forever but learning from a person directly always feels a lot more in-depth.  I’m looking forward to having real-time classes, and hopefully being able to go over understanding/troubleshooting with facilitators in the future. Critiques on projects will also be fantastic.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>DevAcademy is literally my only commitment, everything else is loose</p>
