      <span class="question">What is your long term goal or career pathway? </span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Everyone I’ve met that are happy in their careers went with the flow, taking different opportunities and pivoting along the way as they improve in their field. I feel like especially in the tech sphere it is hard to predict your future role as it keeps updating. </p>
        <p>My intention is to enter the Web Design field using this course and my degree in Visual Communication Design to find an entry web design role. I’d like time to get used to applying my new skills, but overall I hope to seize opportunities and keep upping my skills to advance my career. Maybe even one day working for myself. </p>
    </span>

      <span class="question">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Probably my best strength is that I’ve never stopped learning! I’ve worked a lot of jobs, many of which require training - so I’m used to a professional learning environment. But, in my own time I also like to gain new skills; at the moment I’m learning how to sew and on to my second project in a month. Because I enjoy learning and seeing personal improvement I’m used to being bad at things and having to ask a lot of questions to get better.</p>
        <p>Limitation-wise I can get pretty distracted. If I’m not 100% applied to my work my mind will wander, it’s part of the reason I opted for this bootcamp approach as moving at a fast pace keeps me on task. So far I’ve been making personal deals, for example I’ll agree to work an hour for a grilled cheese sandwich… bribery keeps me motivated. Also the toggl app has been helpful with charting how much actual work I do in the day, so keeping that up will be useful.</p>
        </span>

      <span class="question">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span>
      <span class="answer">
       <p>Networking will be great! I’ve never really understood how people ‘network’, I’ve had friends help me get jobs before, but networking seems like a mysterious skill specific to career advancement. </p>
       <p>Discipline is a skill I’ve always wanted to improve in, I get pretty lenient on myself so I’m hoping through this course I’ll develop some good habits and improve my self-discipline.  That way in the future I’ll be better set up to continue self-study.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</span>
      <span class="sub-question">An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>I’ve set up a routine of being awake at 9 and studying by 9:30am. Then I use the toggl app to chart time, I usually go for a 2 hour chunk unless I’m super into it and then do a little break. My breaks usually involve walking my dog so I’m away from the computer and getting that vitamin D. End of the day I do some yoga to unwind both my brain and body… I spent over a year in lockdown overseas so I’ve gained habits to keep my health up while staying at home.</p>
      <p>Safety wise I’m studying from home, this way just in case anything does happen everyone in my bubble shouldn’t be affected. </p>
      </span>
      <span class="sub-question">What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Step away, take a break. Usually when I’m in that kind of state it’s best to do a reset; as simple as a nap, changing activity, or dragging my friends out. After getting some distance and perspective I’m in a way better headspace to tackle the problem</p>
      </span>
    </span>

      <span class="question">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</span>
      <span class="answer">
     <p>I’m living with my parents for the first time in 10 years, 5 years of that spent overseas. So, they are pretty zoned in on what I’m up to and excited to support me. If I needed help they are always around.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>Having a team available is fantastic, as I can research on the internet forever but learning from a person directly always feels a lot more in-depth.  I’m looking forward to having real-time classes, and hopefully being able to go over understanding/troubleshooting with facilitators in the future. Critiques on projects will also be fantastic.</p>
      </span>

      <span class="question">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>DevAcademy is literally my only commitment, everything else is loose</p>

    </div>

    <div class="entry-contents">
      <span class="question">What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>To understand positioning better I used the sources of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO8ed-JB4So&ab_channel=FollowAndrew" target="_blank">Follow Andrew's CSS Positioning Tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp" target="_blank">W3School</a> , and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/" target="_blank">CSS Tricks.</a></p>
      <p>Positioning controls where an object appears on a document (website). There are 5 different kinds of positioning: Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed and Sticky.</p> 
      <p>First lets cover what the have in common:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>positioning is always based on the 4 attributes; Top, Right, Bottom, and Left</li>
        <li>positioning is controlled by + and - values, + pushes inward from the value and - pushes outward away from the value</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now for the differences!</p>
      <p>Relative:</p>
      <p>Relative positioning is based on the object's default position. Using 'Position: Relative and Top: 100px' the object will move 100px downwards from the top (pushing away) of where the object used to be. When the object's position is changed using Relative it does not effect document flow, what I mean by that is that it leaves a little ghost behind that all other objects will awknowledge as still there despite not displaying there anymore.</p>
      <img src="/images/relative.png">
      <p>Absolute:</p>
      <p>Absolute positioning works on a buddy system. All movement is based on the object's parent element, so for 'Position: Absolute and Top:100px' the object will move 100px down from the top of it's parent. Document flow is affected by Absolute positioning, so when the object moves all other objects will shift to match.</p>
      <img src="/images/absolute.png">
      <p>Fixed:</p>
      <p>Fixed positioning is based on the viewport i.e. the browser. It behaves a lot like Absolute but rather than it's parent being a containing object, it's parent is the browser window itself. So in the case of 'Position: Fixed and Top:100px' the object will move 100px away from the top of the browser window. It also affects document flow, so all other objects on the page will react to the shift.</p>
