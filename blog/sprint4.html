      <span class="question">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</span>
      <span class="answer">
        <p>By understanding the learning process more it is easier to interpret progress and be more forgiving as we grow. Neuroplasticity teaches us ways to approach learning a new subject; for example the ‘Use it or Lose it’/’Use it and Improve it’ mentioned by <a href="https://www.cfimove.org/10-principles-of-neuroplasticity-part-1/" target="_blank">cfimove.org</a>. These principles are all focused on repetition - the more we practice a new concept or skill the more our brain will get used to it and we will change from having to fumble our way through to eventually streamlining and innovating the same skill. By understanding the process we can account for it in our learning to get the most out of our time.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Pretty similar answer to above, by understanding neuroplasticity I can lean on its principles to get the most out of my learning. By emphasizing repetition, focus, and meaning I can approach my learning with intent. There is also an emphasis with neuroplasticity that learning new things is hard and that it will feel like an uphill battle, but that is okay and part of the process.
      </p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Although neuroplasticity is about the learning process, the concept in practice is more about holistic wellbeing. The website <a href="https://neurohacker.com/rewire-your-brain-science-backed-methods-to-boost-neuroplasticity" target="_blank">Neurohacker</a> discusses a few ways to increase neuroplasticity; first and foremost is to be in a good headspace. Looking after yourself by sleeping right, exercising and relaxing will in turn benefit neuroplasticity as it all creates space for cognitive growth.</p>

      <p>This video by Kurzgesagt is about building new habits, I found a lot of neuroplasticity concepts were covered here and I love how they explain the subject.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">Discuss what a Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant.</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Growth mindset is about keeping an open mind about yourself and others. Rather than putting yourself in a box and limiting yourself, the growth mindset is about how everyone can change and develop.</p>
      <p>Through acknowledging this change it then becomes easier as you are in a state of openness and encouragement. Growth Mindset is incredibly relevant as we enter Sprint 4 of foundations as we are just beginning our journey from changing from ‘not a web developer’ to a ‘web developer’ and it can be easy to say I can’t do it or I can’t think like that but instead we need to focus on that fact that we are learning and that we eventually can.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>It was mostly affirming. I was struggling towards the end of Sprint 3 as I was definitely feeling the limitations of what I can do. But, through looking into neuroplasticity and growth mindset I felt better as this is part of the process! The more we study, understand and practice the closer we’ll get to feeling competent in our new skills, especially while being mindful of how we are learning.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Definitely through mindfulness. By approaching this learning journey with intent and openness it will help overcome the downright hard task of learning how to code. Everyone has to go through their own journey to get good at something and we need to keep a growth mindset as we meet obstacles along the way.</p>

      <p>Carol Dweck seems to be the Growth Mindest spokeperson, I recommend reading the comments as it's inspiring to hear examples on how Growth Mindset benefitted other people.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Studying Neuroplasticity gave some insight into learning approaches while Growth mindset helped to inform the attitude to these learning approaches. </p>
      <p>I intend on taking good care of my personal wellbeing to create a strong base for this journey. For both neuroplasticity and growth mindset having a strong physical and mental wellbeing is important to get the most out of the learning process.</p>
      <p>Also the neuroplasticity principles are a great map of learning. By applying the principles within the course itself by; repeating material I’m unsure about, keeping up a rigorous schedule and keeping my overall goal in mind will help me get the most out of this experience.</p>
