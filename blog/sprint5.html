      <span class="question">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Well first is that core learning, or rather sharing these details, makes me uncomfortable. Secondly is that I need to harness more of that growth mindset, it’s hard to let go of self-imposed limitations. Thirdly; the learning plan was a useful layout for what my intentions are for the course and something that I like to refer back to when I need.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Being able to perceive and acknowledge our own and others emotions is integral to working well with others.</p>
      <p>Throughout this course we’ll be working in teams in a stressful environment. Then later when we graduate we will continue to work with others to meet deadlines. Being attuned to values, empathy and self-awareness is advantageous for learning, programming, and life overall.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Nothing really 'surprised' me, but Learning about neuroplasticity was cool.</p>
      <p>I like being able to conceptualize the learning process better i.e. walking over an overgrown path till it’s paved. I think this will be useful going forward.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Trying to be open and sharing about these subjects. I’m still very uncomfortable but I understand that this is a part of the curriculum and try my best.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>Well no one works in isolation, and I imagine programming is particularly team based.</p>
      <p>The better we get at understanding others and ourselves the better we can work in a team. So, hopefully at the end of this course we emerge as promising well-rounded web developers.</p>
      </span>
      <span class="question">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</span>
      <span class="answer">
      <p>It’s not my cup of tea, but I'm just a student so I’m trusting the process.</p>
      <p>The core work is good for variety, as sometimes it’s nice to take a break from tech and still be up to something productive. Overall the devacademy folks seem really proud of this aspect of the course so I’m happy to follow the path.</p>
